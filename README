Boffin Experiment
=================

The Big Boffin experiment was a toy car race between Scott Mills and Mistajam conducted by BBC Radio 1
based on tweets with the hashtag #bbcr1race. Listeners could participate by tweeting @scott_mills or 
@mistajam - each tweet would result in one of the cars moving. The more tweets received, the faster the
cars ran. Check out the video here:

Implementation
--------------

We used:
* The Twitter Streaming API
* A Ruby script using the TweetStream Gem to fetch tweets in realtime
* The Ruby script posted to an HTTP->USB server written in C (https://github.com/njh/k8055httpd)
* A Velleman K8055 and a Velleman K8056 kits
